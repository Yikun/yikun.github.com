strNormalizedFileName: This output file records the synthetic
          microbiome data for null community (no spike-in and
          outliers), outlier-added community without spike-in and final
          spiked data. We put samples in columns and features in rows.
          The first chunk of the file is metadata, with row names
          Metadata_. The second chunk is for null community, with row
          names Feature_Lognormal_. The third chunk is for
          outlier-introduced community, with row names
          Feature_Outlier_*. The last chunk is for spiked data, with
          row names Feature_spike. This file records relative abundance
          data.

strCountFileName: This output file has the same organization as the
          file strNormalizedFileName but records raw counts data.

parameter_filename: This output file records diagnostic information and
          values of model parameters as well as the spike-in
          assignment. The most part of this file is used only for
          debugging. Users can focus on lines after Minimum Spiked-in
          Samples. Those lines record which metadata are correlated
          with which feature. The format is all metadata that are
          correlated with a specific features are listed under the name
          of the feature.

bugs_to_spike: Number of bugs to correlate with others. A non-negative
          integer value is expected.

spikeFile: The name of the file where the correlation values are
          stored. Should have fields `Domain`, `Range`, and
          `Correlation`.

calibrate: Calibration file for generating the random log normal data.
          TSV file (column = feature).

datasetCount: The number of bug-bug spiked datasets to generate.  A
          positive integer value is expected.

read_depth: Simulated read depth for counts. A positive integer value
          is expected.

number_features: The number of features per sample to create. A
          positive integer value is expected.

bugBugCorr: A vector of string separated values for the correlation
          values of the pairwise bug-bug associations. This is the
          correlation of the log-counts. Values are comma-separated;
          for example: 0.7,0.5. Default is 0.5.

spikeCount: Counts of spiked metadata used in the spike-in dataset -
          These values should be comma delimited values, in the order
          of the spikeStrength values (if given), Can be one value, in
          this case the value will be repeated to pair with the
          spikeCount values (if multiple are present). For example
          1,2,3.

lefse_file: Folder containing lefSe inputs.

percent_spiked: The percent of features spiked-in. A real number
          between 0 and 1 is expected.

minLevelPercent: Minimum percent of measurements out of the total a
          level can have in a discontinuous metadata (rounded up to the
          nearest count). A real number between 0 and 1 is expected.

number_samples: The number of samples to generate. A positive integer
          greater than 0 is expected.

max_percent_outliers: The maximum percent of outliers to spike into a
          sample. A real number between 0 and 1 is expected.

number_metadata: Indicates how many metadata are created,
          number_metadata*2 = number continuous metadata,
          number_metadata = number binary metadata, number_metadata =
          number quaternary metadata, A positive integer greater than 0
          is expected.

spikeStrength: Strength of the metadata association with the spiked-in
          feature, These values should be comma delimited and in the
          order of the spikeCount values (if given),Can be one value,
          in this case the value will be repeated to pair with the
          spikeStrength values (if multiple are present). For example
          0.2,0.3,0.4.

    seed: A seed to freeze the random generation of counts/relative
          abundance,If left as default (NA), generation is random - If
          seeded, data generation will be random within a run but
          identical if ran again under the same settings,an integer is
          expected.

percent_outlier_spikins: The percent of samples to spike in outliers. A
          real number between 0 to 1 is expected.

minOccurence: Minimum counts a bug can have for the occurrence quality
          control filter used when creating bugs (filtering minimum
          number of counts in a minimum number of samples).  A positive
          integer is expected.

 verbose: If True logging and plotting is made by the underlying
          methodology.  This is a flag, it is either included or not
          included in the command line, no value needed.

minSample: Minimum samples a bug can be in for the occurrence quality
          control filter used when creating bugs (filtering minimum
          number of counts in a minimum number of samples). A positive
          integer is expected.

scalePercentZeros: A scale used to multiply the percent zeros of all
          features across the sample after it is derived from the
          relationships with it and the feature abundance or
          calibration file. Requires a number greater than 0. A number
          greater than 1 increases sparsity, a number less than 1
          decreases sparsity, O removes sparsity, 1 (default) does not
          change the value and the value.

association_type: The type of association to generate. Options are
          'linear' or 'rounded_linear'.

noZeroInflate: If given, zero inflation is not used when generating a
          feature. This is a flag, it is either included or not
          included in the command line, no value needed.

noRunMetadata: If given, no metadata files are generated, This is a
          flag, it is either included or not included in the command
          line, no value needed.

runBugBug: If given, bug-bug interaction files are generated in
          addition to any metadata files. This is a flag, it is either
          included or not included in the command line, no value
          needed.
