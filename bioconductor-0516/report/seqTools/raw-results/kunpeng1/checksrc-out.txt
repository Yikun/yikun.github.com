File ‘/home/biocbuild/R/R-4.3.0-bin/site-library/seqTools/libs/seqTools.so’:
  Found ‘__sprintf_chk’, possibly from ‘sprintf’ (C)

Compiled code should not call entry points which might terminate R nor
write to stdout/stderr instead of to the console, nor use Fortran I/O
nor system RNGs nor [v]sprintf. The detected symbols are linked into
the code but might come from libraries and not actually be called.
