Problems with news in ‘NEWS’:
  Cannot process chunk/lines:
    CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.2
    # This is the new numbering scheme apologies - we are all up-to-date now and now cell ranger >= 5 will # work on bioconductor, so let's all just take that as a win.
    * added dot.size parameter to scatterClonotype
    * filteringMulti now subsets clonotypes with contains >=2, to prevent 2 of the same chains
    * changed how coldata is added to SCE objects using merge instead of union
    * Can now add BCR and TCR simultaneously by making large list
    * scatter plotting code is not so ugly and allows for user to select dot.size as a variable on the x or y axis
    * Removed regressClonotype function - too many dependencies required, adding an additional vignette to go through the process
    * Added chain option to visualizations and combineExpression to allow users to facilitate single chains - removed chain option from combineTCR/BCR/TRUST4 (the combined object will have both chains no matter what)
    * Added NA filter to combineTCR/BCR/TRUST4 for cell barcodes with only NA values
    * Added NA filter to expression2List() for cells with NA clonotypes.
    * Updated VizGene to order the genes automatically by highest to lowest variance
    * Updated VizGene to pull the correct genes based on selection
    * Updated parse method - old version had issue with place V-->J-->D in the TRB/Heavy chains 
    * Simplified the clonalDiversity() to allow for more options in organizing plot and box plots. 
    * CombineExpression() adds the groupBy variable to Frequency, allowing for multiple calculations to be saved in the meta data. 
    * Default color scheme now uses viridis plasma, because it I am on transfusion medicine.
  Cannot process chunk/lines:
    CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.2
    # Working on renumbering versions for consistency - this is the new current dev branch
    # The below have not been implemented into the master branch or the bioconductor version
    * added the combineTRUST4 function to parse contigs from TUST4 pipeline
    * added the filter of contigs by chain in the combineTCR, combineBCR, and combineTRUST4 functions
    * no longer require the ID in the combineTCR/BCR/TRUST4 functions
    * added jaccard index for overlap analysis
    * replaced vizVgene with vizGene - allowing users to look at any gene in the combinedContig object
    * Fixed coloring scale on the overlap analysis
    * Added regressClonotype function using harmony to remove the clonotype effect on feature space
    * allowed occupiedRepertoire to use proportion.
    * added scatterClonotype function to Viz.R
